# Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
This is the askthemanuel repository. Follow these instructions when working on issues, generating code, or providing suggestions.

## General Guidelines
- Make minimal, focused changes that directly address the issue at hand
- Avoid unnecessary refactoring or reformatting of existing code
- Ensure all changes are well-documented and easy to understand
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions in the repository

## Issue Handling
- Fully understand the issue requirements before making changes
- Break down complex issues into smaller, manageable tasks
- Always validate changes work as expected before completion
- Include clear commit messages that describe what was changed and why

## Code Quality
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Add comments only when necessary to explain complex logic
- Follow language-specific best practices and conventions
- Ensure code changes don't introduce security vulnerabilities

## Testing
- Run existing tests to ensure changes don't break functionality
- Add tests for new features or bug fixes when appropriate
- Validate changes manually when applicable

## Documentation
- Update documentation when making changes that affect usage
- Keep README and other docs accurate and up-to-date
- Use clear and concise language in documentation

## Version Control
- Make small, incremental commits
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Keep the git history clean and meaningful

## Boundaries
- Do not make changes outside the scope of the current issue
- Do not add new dependencies unless absolutely necessary
- Do not modify working code unless required to fix the issue
- Always ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous
